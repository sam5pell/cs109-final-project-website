# Conclusions and Future Work
The model we created was quite effective. We found that our model was between 87-92% accurate, notably predicting three challengers beating incumbents, and one open race. There is, of course, room for improvement in our model. As specified throughout the report, the main differentiator between good and best models is the ability to accurately predict the battleground districts. In this regard, there are many models that perform better than ours.

How should we improve our model? We see that competing models for the midterm elections include far more data in general. One of the challengers of predicting battleground races is that the demographics of the states are constantly changing. For example, Texas has been a republican stronghold for decades, but because there has been a large demographic change due to an influx of people from Latin America, old models based around incumbency and partisanship may not be as accurate anymore. For this project, we did not have the data necessary to accurately reflect these changes in demographics.

In the future, a way to improve our model would be to use a model based around campaign fundraising, incumbency etc. along with models that use census data to predict how the actual population leans politically. For example, we could use income and education levels to predict how individuals will vote along with their likelihood to vote, and then use this to predict the vote count of a candidate. When incorporated with how much money the candidate spend and the incumbency factor, this could be a way to include the demographic changes.
