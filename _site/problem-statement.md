# Problem Statement
Our goal was to explain the outcomes of the 2018 midterm House elections by identifying districts that would flip parties following the election. In particular, we built two models. The first was used to identify states that had the *potential* to flip parties and the second was used to more accurately identify those states that have the potential to flip that will actually flip.

# Motivation
Our team aimed to predict the U.S. 2018 midterm election results, particularly for those districts in which *party flipping* was likely.
