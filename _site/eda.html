<h3 id="voting-trends">Voting Trends</h3>
<p>We started by exploring voting trends in the Senate to gain an overview of party leanings in each state. We used a dataset that included the number of votes each candidate received in each state for all Senate elections from 1976-2016. We then created a new dataset where each observation represents a given state and includes information on the percentage of the total votes that the republican, democratic, and independent candidates received in each state in each year.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>elections['percentage'] = elections['candidatevotes'] / elections['totalvotes']
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We then plotted the results for each state:

<p><strong>MAYBE USE THIS TO EXPLAIN WHY WE DON’T CARE ABOUT INDEPENDENT</strong></p>

<h3 id="finding-swing-states">Finding Swing States</h3>
<p>In order to explore the current number of swing states, we used Beautiful Soup to scrape the Cook Partisan Voting Index <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Partisan_Voting_Index">wikipedia page</a>. Specifically we scraped a table sourced from the Cook Political Report’s 2016 analysis for districts of the 116th United States Congress, calculated according to the results of the 2012 and the 2016 U.S. presidential elections.</p>

<p>The data scraped required some cleaning including stripping newline characters and converting string versions of integers to numerical values. The final table had the following structure:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>District</th>
      <th>PVI</th>
      <th>Party</th>
      <th>Points</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Alabama 1</td>
      <td>R+15</td>
      <td>R</td>
      <td>15</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Alabama 2</td>
      <td>R+16</td>
      <td>R</td>
      <td>16</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Alabama 3</td>
      <td>R+16</td>
      <td>R</td>
      <td>16</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Alabama 4</td>
      <td>R+30</td>
      <td>R</td>
      <td>30</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Using this table we calculated the number of swings districts where a swing state is defined as any state with a score between D+5 and R+5. A district could also have a score of ‘EVEN’ if they showed no leaning in either direction. The following two graphs visualize the results.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>swing_states_df = pvi_by_district_df.loc[(pvi_by_district_df['Points'] &lt;= 5)]
dem_swings = swing_states_df[swing_states_df['Party'] == 'D'].sort_values(by=['Points'])
rep_swings = swing_states_df[swing_states_df['Party'] == 'R'].sort_values(by=['Points'])
even = swing_states_df[swing_states_df['PVI'] == 'EVEN']
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/images/dem_swing_states.png" alt="Dem Swing States" />
<img src="/images/rep_swing_states.png" alt="Rep Swing States" /></p>

<p>The following districts had an even score.</p>
<ul>
  <li>California 10</li>
  <li>California 25</li>
  <li>California 29</li>
  <li>Florida 7</li>
  <li>Oregon 4</li>
  <li>Oregon 5</li>
  <li>Washington 8</li>
  <li>Washington 3</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="flipping-trends-by-state">Flipping Trends by State</h3>

<p>Next, we were interested in looking at trends in flipping where we define flipping to be a given district electing a candidate from the party their current candidate does <strong>not</strong> belong to (ex. a district with a sitting democratic representative electing a republican representative).</p>

<p>We used a data set that contained constituency (district) returns for elections to the House of Representatives from 1976 to 2018 to accomplish this task. Since each row in the original data set represented one candidate, we modified the data to have one row per district per year (ex. Alabama 1 1978) with a new column representing the election outcome in that district in that year (1 indicating a democratic candidate won and 0 indicating a republican candidate won). In addition, we wanted each entry to include information on the previous two elections in that district, so we added four additional columns, two representing the vote counts for the democratic and republican candidates in the n-1th election and two representing the vote counts for the democratic and republican candidates in the n-2th election. The final table had the following form:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>id</th>
      <th>year</th>
      <th>state</th>
      <th>district</th>
      <th>prev_dem_votes</th>
      <th>prev_rep_votes</th>
      <th>prev_total_votes</th>
      <th>prev2_dem_votes</th>
      <th>prev2_rep_votes</th>
      <th>prev2_total_votes</th>
      <th>res</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1980Alabama1</td>
      <td>1980</td>
      <td>Alabama</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>40450</td>
      <td>71711</td>
      <td>112161</td>
      <td>58906</td>
      <td>98257</td>
      <td>157163</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1980Alabama2</td>
      <td>1980</td>
      <td>Alabama</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>49341</td>
      <td>57924</td>
      <td>107265</td>
      <td>66288</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>66288</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1980Alabama3</td>
      <td>1980</td>
      <td>Alabama</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>106935</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>106935</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1980Alabama4</td>
      <td>1980</td>
      <td>Alabama</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>87380</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>87380</td>
      <td>141490</td>
      <td>34531</td>
      <td>176021</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Next, we were interested in exploring if there were particular states that were more prone to having districts that flip. In order to do this, we calculated how many district elections in each state were flips from 1980-2018 and divided that number by the total number of elections in that state to give us a percentage of elections that were flips in that state over that time period. We obtained the following results:</p>

<p><img src="/images/flips_by_state_1977_2018.png" alt="Flips by State Per Year" /></p>

<h3 id="flipping-trends-by-year">Flipping Trends by Year</h3>
<p>We were also interested in looking for trends in the number of flips in all elections in a given year. We were able to do this by using our table that includes the results of the nth election and n-1th election in one row. Our results indicated that there has been a decline in the number of swing districts in the previous two elections (2014 and 2016).</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>flips_by_year = {}
for i in range(1980, 2018, 2):
    flips = 0
    for j in range(len(past_elections[past_elections['year'] == i])):
        row = past_elections[past_elections['year'] == i].iloc[j]
        dems = int(row['prev_dem_votes'])
        reps = int(row['prev_rep_votes'])
        res = row['res'].bool()
        if dems &gt; reps and res == False or dems &lt; reps and res == True:
            flips += 1
    flips_by_year[i] = flips
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><img src="images/flips_by_year.png" alt="Flips Per Year" /></p>

<h3 id="polarization-of-voters">Polarization of Voters</h3>
<p>To further understand the political climate at the time of the 2018 election, we wanted to explore the polarization of voters in each state (meaning how democratic or how republican a state is). We used a dataset that included the results of the 2016 General Election. We specifically looked at the number of votes cast for the democratic candidate and republican candidate in each state in 2016. We then added a column to the table that represented the difference between the number of votes for the democratic and republican candidates calculated by:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ge_party_votes_2016_1['Difference'] = ge_party_votes_2016_1.apply(lambda row: (row['Republican Candidates'] - row['Democratic Candidates']) / (row['Republican Candidates'] + row['Democratic Candidates']), axis=1)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The final table had the following form:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>State</th>
      <th>Democratic Candidates</th>
      <th>Republican Candidates</th>
      <th>Other Candidates</th>
      <th>Difference</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>AL</td>
      <td>2100167.0</td>
      <td>3875377.0</td>
      <td>124957.0</td>
      <td>0.297079</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>AK</td>
      <td>263673.0</td>
      <td>456624.0</td>
      <td>217950.0</td>
      <td>0.267877</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>AS</td>
      <td>2740.0</td>
      <td>8923.0</td>
      <td>171.0</td>
      <td>0.530138</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>AZ</td>
      <td>3227099.0</td>
      <td>3876046.0</td>
      <td>412814.0</td>
      <td>0.091361</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The following map shows the results, where the more red a state is, the more republican it is and the more blue a state is, the more democratic it is. Purple states fall somewhere in between.
