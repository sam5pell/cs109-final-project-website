<h2 id="baseline-model">Baseline Model</h2>
<p>We wanted to create a baseline model based off of previous midterm election results. We create a dataset where each row in the model represents a specific district in a specific year from 1976-2016 (see the EDA page for more info). Our predictors included state, district, and the number of votes for the republican candidates and democratic candidates in the 2 elections prior to the given election.</p>

<p>Because we could not use the current year’s results as a predictor, we used the results from the previous two midterm elections in our model. For example, to predict the outcome of 2000Alabama1 we could not use the number of republican and democratic votes from that year (because we wouldn’t have that for 2018), so instead we used the vote counts from 1998Alabama1 (one election prior) and 1996Alabama1 (two elections prior). Below we use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">all_past_elections</code> dataframe (described in EDA) to appropriately assign those values. We then combine these new results in a new data frame.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># separate into test and training data
columns = ['state']
past_elections_dummies = pd.get_dummies(past_elections, columns=columns, drop_first=True)

election_2018 = past_elections_dummies.loc[past_elections['year'] == 2018]
all_past_elections = past_elections_dummies.loc[past_elections['year'] != 2018]
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>past_res =  all_past_elections['res']
all_past_elections = all_past_elections.drop(columns=['res', 'id'])
election_res_2018 =  election_2018['res']
election_2018 = election_2018.drop(columns=['res', 'id'])
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We ran a logistic regression model on the data at this point and found a training accuracy score of <strong>78.22%</strong> and a test accuracy score of <strong>79.08%</strong>.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>X_train, y_train = normalize(all_past_elections.astype(float)), past_res.astype(float)
X_test, y_test = normalize(election_2018.astype(float)), election_res_2018.astype(float)

log_model = LogisticRegression(C=100000, solver='lbfgs', max_iter=1000).fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred_log_train = log_model.predict(X_train)
y_proba_log_test = log_model.predict_proba(X_train)

y_pred_log_test = log_model.predict(X_test)
y_proba_log_test = log_model.predict_proba(X_test)

train_acc = accuracy_score(y_train, y_pred_log_train)*100
test_acc = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_log_test)*100
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above model yielded the following results:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Training Accuracy Score</strong>: 78.22%</li>
  <li><strong>Test Accuracy Score</strong>: 79.08%</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="images/baseline_probs.png" alt="Baseline Model Prediction Probabilities" /></p>

<p>We created a confusion matrix of the results which yielded the following:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th> </th>
      <th>Predicted 0</th>
      <th>Predicted 1</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Actual 0</strong></td>
      <td>187</td>
      <td>16</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Actual 1</strong></td>
      <td>75</td>
      <td>157</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>From the above confusion matrix, we can see that the baseline model does an okay job of predicting election outcomes, but, for the test data, had a tendency to predict incorrectly for districts where democrats won.</p>

<h1 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h1>
<p><img src="images/voting_trends.png" alt="1976-2016 Voting Trends" />
We returned to one of our original visualization (found on the EDA page) to identify voting trends among the states to assist in predicting the midterm outcomes. For example, if a state historically voted heavily Democrat (Massachusetts), then we want our model to weight the likelihood of any Democrat running in MA much heavier than a Republican state such as Texas. We also wanted to identify potential swing states, or states that historically voted on way but have been trending towards the other party in recent years. We graphed the percentage of votes Republicans, Democrats, and Independents received per state in Senate elections from 1976-2016. From this collection of graphs, we can identify many trends occurring in different states. We can also see many states used to heavily favor one party then began voting in the other direction. For example, southern states such as AL and OK used to vote heavily Democrat until they switched to heavy Republican, likely a result of the Southern Bloc.</p>

<p>Noting these trends in the Senate data inspired us to further explore swing seats in the Senate specifically. We explain how this changed our project direction more on the <a href="results">results page</a>.</p>

<h1 id="final-model">Final Model</h1>
<p>We looked to greatly improve our model from the previous milestone, so we expanded the scope of the data to many other areas as mentioned previously. We first started by switching from using 1976-2016 House election data to 1976-2016 Senate election data, obviously much more relevant to our prediction goals. From there, we looked to integrate fundraising numbers, incumbency vs. challenger vs. open seat status, and previous election party voting polarization into the model.</p>

<p>The issue was figuring out how to merge of all this data together into one dataset so a model could easily train on it. We had two main sources of data - fundraising per year from 2012 elections onwards which integrated the status of the candidate (incumbent vs. challenger vs. open seat) into it and voting numbers from 1976-2016. We ultimately decided to use voting numbers from the 2006 election and append them to 2012 fundraising data so we could have the previous state election’s voter data based on party. We did the same from 2008/2014 and 2010/2016 election data, and appended 2012 data to 2018 election data for predictions. We decided not to use any data prior to 2008 since it was difficult with the fundraising data going back only to 2012, and we felt the most recent elections we more relevant anyways.</p>

<p>Each row in the fundraising data was a specific candidate, so our model was trained on everything related to a candidate including their state, candidate status, party, party’s previous election vote percentage, and fundraising amounts. The problem with this, however, is training a model and simply predicting on the 2018 fundraising data does not take into account the one winner per senate seat rule. This could lead to the model predicting multiple winners for one senate seat and none for others. To overcome this issue, we predicted the probability that each candidate would win the election and grouped each candidate and his/her predicted probability per state. We then chose the candidate with the highest predicted probability of winning as the winner.</p>

<p>Our final model uses <strong>Logistic Regression</strong> run with the liblinear library and l1 regularization. We used 5-fold cross-validation in the training process as well. This resulted in, depending the train-test split, a training accuracy of ~0.92 and testing accuracy of ~0.87-0.92. We ran many other models including different types of logistic regressions, KNN, AdaBoostClassifier, and random forests, but we found our specific logistic regression model to find a good balance between accuracy and not overfitting.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(fundraising.loc[:, fundraising.columns != 'elected'],
                                                    fundraising.elected, test_size=0.25)
