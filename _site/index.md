# Problem Statement
Our team aimed to predict the U.S. 2018 midterm election results, particularly for those districts in which *party flipping* was likely. Our goal was to first identify states that have the *potential* to flip parties and then more accurately identify which of those states will actually flip. After creating a well-performing base model, we decided to build a secondary model predicting the outcome of the 2016 Senate elections using fundraising data, which is not easily accessible for House elections, and incumbency data. Our goal was to determine whether or not these predictors could help a model better predict election outcomes in swing states generally.

# Motivation
Upon approaching this project we first worked to identify the general process of the midterm elections. Unlike presidential elections, midterm elections occur every two years and they take place at the granularity of district. In the United States there are 435 voting districts each representing just over 700,000 citizens. Every two years all seats of the House of Representatives will be open to new candidates.

Predicting the results of the 2018 of the U.S. midterm elections can demonstrate the usefulness or validity of a model for future elections. As the election process is pretty well-defined, identifying patterns and metrics that are indicative of election outcomes in 2018 will be useful across future elections. Generally, midterm elections are important because members of the House play a crucial role in the U.S. government policy pipeline - they are one of the earliest and largest bottlenecks for the passing of new bills. The makeup of the House is also reflective of the current administrationâ€™s political leaning and is highly correlated with the ability for a partisan government to pass meaningful policy for its constituency.

Predicting the results of the midterm elections is difficult because of the non-uniformity of complexity in the problem. What we mean by that is: there is a high difficulty in predicting the election results in districts prone to flipping, and otherwise, it easy to predict the outcome in demographically well-defined districts. Districts *prone to flipping*, or battleground districts, are districts in which there is not a high likelihood of the incumbent party reclaiming the seat in the House. As you may guess, most districts are demographically and politically homogenous. Such locations, will almost always vote for the incumbent party, and thus, these results are trivial to predict. To make a strong model for this problem it is necessary to assume well-defined regions as easy predictions, and to instead invest time in identifying what data distinguishes candidates in battleground districts.

Our preliminary data search and EDA was focused on general district information. How many voters? Party affiliation of the candidate? Party of affiliations of past victor? These predictors made an ostensibly strong model. Yet, the data we collected was not as useful for predicting political contentious districts. We then motivated our EDA towards accentuating the differences between candidates and parties in battleground districts. This drove our data search more towards campaign funding and other candidate-specific data. We found that such information was not easily accessible for candidates running in House elections, however, we were able to obtain it for Senate candidates. In order to further develop our model, we were interested in the ability of such data to predict battleground outcomes in general, so we chose to build models that use such data to predict Senate outcomes in order to determine whether or not working to obtain such data for House elections would be useful.
